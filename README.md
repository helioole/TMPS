## Theory
SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle,
and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses 
a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of 
responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. 
By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, 
testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. 
These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development 
community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.

## Objectives:

1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).
2. Select a domain area for the sample project.
3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.
4. Respect SOLID Principles in your project.

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
`A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.`
